### Project overview

For my final project of the first module in 'Full-Stack Development with JavaScript' at University of Washington Professional & Continuing Education I created a *several pages mini-project* with the help of which a user can get a random book recommendation or movie reviews by title.

### Requirements

 - Testable code with Jasmine unit tests: implemented in best-buddy.spec.js
 - Fetch requests to a 3rd party API https://developer.nytimes.com/
 - Local storage usage: implemented localStorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem
 - Form field validation: implemented on movie review page
