Hi there, 

This is my final project for the 'JSCRIPT 320 B Programming for the browser in Javascript' UW Continuum College course.
I created a several pages mini-project with the help of which a user can get a random book recommendation or movie reviews by title.

Tha data comes from 'The New York Times Developer Network' https://developer.nytimes.com/.


Enjoy!
